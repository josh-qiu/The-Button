# The Button, A Social Experiment Discord Bot

"The Button" is an infamous online meta-game social experiment that featured a single button with a 60 second timer that would reset every time the button was pressed. The Button went live on reddit on 1st April 2015 and was active up until 5th June, the first time that no user pressed the button before the timer reached zero. A user could only press the button **one time**, and depending on the time the button was at they were given a rank.

Through this system and the two months the button was active, ideologies surrounding the button began to develop and clash. Non-pressers, high and low rankers, and those that wanted the button to live or die. Whatever one's belief was, the button dominated the life of everyone who participated.

This discord bot was made to bring the button to local discord servers and friend groups. Modifiable rules allow this bot to be implemented in any sized server, and simple commands can be used to statistically record the progress of the game. 
- >rank @username: Check what rank someone is
- >press : Press the button and get your rank.
- >stats : Check presser stats

A fun redesign of the button and its colors give life and meaning to its existing, no doubt inevitable creating even more polarized ideologies and cults.

Default time is an 8 hour timer that is constantly ticking down. Every time The Button is pressed the timer will reset. If no one presses the button in that time, The Button will be gone forever. Whenever you press The Button the channel will reward you for saving it in the form of a rank. Ranks are given as discord roles, which can be seen by other people. Pressing The Button closer to death will yield a higher rank. Aim to get the highest rank you can.

See how long the button will last in your server!
